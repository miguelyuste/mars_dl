Collection of scripts created for Joanneum Research's Mars Deep Learning project and my master's thesis "Dreaming Worlds: a Generative Approach to 3D Geomorphological Data Augmentation for Planetary Exploration" (which can be found under https://www.know-center.at/en/research/publications/theses/#1318). 

## THESIS ABSTRACT
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are currently seeing wide application in data augmentation tasks. While most studies focus on the generation
of image datasets, little research has thus far focused on geomorphological data. In this work, we propose an innovative way of applying GANs to the production of synthetic tridimensional scenes through the generation of RGB-depth images in the context of an industry planetary exploration use case. These landscape objects not only encapsulate 3D coordinates but also colour textures, both drawn from the distribution of colour and depth values of real Martian landscapes. To enable this, we present an end-to-end pipeline, consisting of an RGB-depth data collection strategy using widelyavailable open-source 3D computer graphics software, a preprocessing and data preparation strategy, the Spatial GAN neural architecture (SGAN) and a 3D conversion post-processing module. With the help of this pipeline, we manage to generate artificial tridimensional Martian environments that look strikingly realistic to the human eye. Lastly, we explore the limits of this approach and possible improvements to it.
